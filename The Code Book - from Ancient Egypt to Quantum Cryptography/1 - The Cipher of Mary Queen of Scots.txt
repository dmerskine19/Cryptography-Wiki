In this chapter, we are introduced to the concept of cryptography and its long history. 
The author, Simon Singh, shares the story of Mary Queen of Scots, who used a cipher to send secrets to her supporters during her imprisonment. 
The cipher involved the substition of letters for symbols and was said to be "unbreakable". 
This chapter also shared the concept of frequency analysis to reveal the plaintext message, which is how this cipher was broken. 
This story is about the importance of cryptography in politics and warfare, as well as the evolving techniques used in code-making and code-breaking over time.


-Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned in England in the 16th century after being forced to abdicate the Scottish throne.
-Mary's used a simple substitution cipher.
-Once Mary's code was deciphered, she was executed for treason lol.
-early example of the power of cryptography and the importance of protecting secret information.
-cat-and-mouse game between code-makers and code-breakers.
