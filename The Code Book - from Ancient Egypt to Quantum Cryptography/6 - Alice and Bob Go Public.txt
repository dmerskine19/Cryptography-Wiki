Chapter 6 - "Alice and Bob Go Public" 

This chapter focuses on the concept of public key cryptography. 
The chapter shows the evolution of cryptographic techniques and how the development of public key cryptography was game-changing. 
also exploring the widespread use of public key cryptography in modern communication, like banking and e-commerce. 
howing the importance of encryption, and the challenges involved in balancing individual privacy and government surveillance. 



Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses two different keys, one public and one private, to encrypt and decrypt messages. 

	-The public key is to encrypt messages, and the private key is to decrypt. 
	-The public key can be shared openly, whereas the private key is kept secret. 

The chapter discusses Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who introduced the idea of public key cryptography.

And also covers the development of the RSA algorithm, which was independently discovered by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. 
An algorithm that uses the difficulty of factoring large numbers to provide secure communication.
