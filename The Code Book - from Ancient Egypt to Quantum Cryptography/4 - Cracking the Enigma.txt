Chapter 3 - The Mechanization of Secrecy

-During World War I
-the invention of the radio and the need for secure communication led to the development of machine-based encryption.
-The first machine-based cipher was the German Enigma machine, which used a series of rotors to scramble the plaintext.
-The Enigma machine - was considered unbreakable, but was able to reverse-engineer the machine and develop a method for cracking its code.
-the crack allowed the Allies to intercept and decode German messages throughout World War II.

Main idea: the importance of constantly improving cryptography and the cat-and-mouse game of encryption.
