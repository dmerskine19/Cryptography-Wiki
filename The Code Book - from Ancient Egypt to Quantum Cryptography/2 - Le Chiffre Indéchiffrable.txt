Chapter 2 - Le Chiffre Indéchiffrable

This was all about the idea of 'perfect secrecy' and its limitations. The one-time pad is a method of encryption that provides perfect secrecy by using a random key. Check the wiki page on this topic. 
However, the author points out that the one-time pad is difficult to implement in practice because it requires secure key distribution and the keys can only be used once. 
It is also important to note that once the length of the key was known, it was easier to crack the cipher using frequency analysis and other techniques.
Even thought the french abandoned Le Chiffre Indéchiffrable in favor of more secure ciphers, it shared a big role in the development of cryptography.

Main idea: demonstrates the limitations of perfect secrecy and the importance of key management in practical cryptography.
